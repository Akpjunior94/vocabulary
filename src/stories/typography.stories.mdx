# Text styles

The main fonts used across all Creative Commons' sites are Source Sans Pro and Roboto Condensed. Both are available on
Google Fonts, support a wide range of languages, and were designed to be displayed digitally.

The text styles defined should be used depending on the content displayed. For titles and short-length calls, Roboto
Condensed is the option. For long reads and descriptive sentences, Source Sans Pro. To not to risk the content
legibility, Roboto Condensed was adapted by adding 2% of kerning. In both cases, the main color for white background is
DarkSlateGray color.

Depending on the situation, some styles can be adapted having in mind that the number of styles implemented should keep
simple. The criteria used to apply Roboto or Source Sans Pro for titles must put legibility over aesthetic. Based on
that, we created title styles for both fonts.
